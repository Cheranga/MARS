### Assumptions
   - In the console application the user always enter valid data
   
### Done
   - The ```GenericHandler``` can handle both 2D and 3D cartesian maps.

### TODO   
   - Write more unit tests and ingegration tests
   - Refactor the classes which represents 2D states (NorthState, EastState, etc...) to implement ```IGenericState```
   - Refactor to have specific 2D and 3D handler classes which sets the correct configuration in the ```GenericHandler``` class.
